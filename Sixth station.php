<h1>VERONICA WIPES THE FACE OF JESUS</h1><br> V.  We adore you, and we bless you. <br> R.<b>Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.<br><br><br><center><img src="img/sixth.jpg"></center><br> From the Prophet Isaiah</b><br><br> Who would believe what we have heard, and to whom has the power of Yahweh been revealed? Like a sapling he grew up in front of us, like a root in arid ground. Without beauty, without majesty we say him, no looks to attract our eyes: a thing despise and rejected by men, a man of sorrow and familiar with suffering, a man to make people screen their faces: he was despised and we took no account of him. (Is. 53: 1-3)<br><br><br><b>Words of Our Lord</b><br><br><em>Whoever sees me, sees who sent me. I, the light, have come into the world, so that Whoever believes in me need not stay in dark any more.</em>(Jn. 12: 45-46)<br><br><br>Let us pray:</b><br><br>God our Father, no secret is hidden from you, for ever heart is open to you and every wish is known. Fill our hearts with the light of your Holy Spirit to free our thoughts from sin, that we may perfectly love you and fittingly praise you. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen <br> V. Have mercy on us, O Lord!<br><br><br> R. <b>Have mercy on us</b><br><br><br> <b>Hymn:</b> Bruised, derided, cursed, defiled,<br>She beheld her tender child,<br>All with bloody scourges rent.<br>
