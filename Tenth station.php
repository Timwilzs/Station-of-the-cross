      <h1>JESUS IS STRIPPED OF HIS GARMENTS</h1><br> V.  We adore you, and we bless you. <br> R.<b>Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.<br><br><br><center><img src="img/tenth.jpg"></center><br> From the Gosple of St. John</b><br><br> When the soldiers had finished crucifying Jesus they took his clothing and divided it into four shares one for each soldier. His undergarment was seamless, woven in one piece from neck to hem; so they said to one another, <em>instead of tearing it, let's throw dice to decide who is to have it.</em> In this way the words of Scripture were fulfilled: <em>They shared out my clothing amoung they. They cast lots for my clothes.</em> This is exactly what the soldiers did (Jn. 19: 23-24).<br><br><br><b>Words of Our Lord<br><br><em>I have come to bring fire to the earth, and how i wish it were blazing already! There is a baptism I must still recieve, and how great is my distress till it is over!</em>(Lk. 12: 49-50)<br><br><br>Let us pray:<br><br>Lord, by the suffering of Christ your Son you have saved us all from the death we inherited from sinful Adam. By the law of nature we have borne the likeness of his manhood. May the sanctifying power of grace help us to put on the the likeness of our Lord in heaven.</b> We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen <br><br> V. Have mercy on us, O Lord!<br> R. <b>Have mercy on us</b><br><br> <b>Hymn:</b> Holy Mother, pierce me through,<br> In my hearth each wound renew <br> Of my Saviour Crucified.<br>
