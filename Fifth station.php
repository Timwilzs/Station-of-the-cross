<h1>THE CROSS IS LAID UPON SIMON OF CYRENE</h1><br> V.  We adore you, and we bless you. <br> R.<b>Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.<br><br><br><center><img src="img/fifth.jpg"></center><br> From the Gosple of St. Mark</b><br><br>They enlisted a passer-by, Simon of Cyrene, Father of Alexander and Rufus, who was coming in from the country, to carry his cross (MK. 15: 21).<br><br><br><b>Words of Our Lord<br><br><em>The disciple is not superior to his teacher, nor the slave to his master, it is enough for the disciple that he should grow to be like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, what will they not say of his household? Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul; fear him rather who can destroy both body and soul in hell</em> (Mt. 10: 24-25, 28).<br><br><br>Let us pray</b><br><br>Father, by the blood of your own Son you have set all men free and saved us from death. Continue your work of love within us, that by constantly ceebrating the mystery of salvation we may reach the enternal life it promises. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen <br><br><br> V. Have mercy on us, O Lord!<br> R. <b>Have mercy on us</b><br><br> <b>Hymn:</b> Can the human heart refrain<br>From partaking in her pain,<br>in that mother's pain untold.<br>
