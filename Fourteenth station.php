      <h1>JESUS IS PLACED IN THE SEPULCHRE</h1><br> V.  We adore you, and we bless you. <br> R.<b>Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.<br><br><br><center><img src="img/fourteenth.jpg"></center><br> From the Gosple of St. John</b><br><br>They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it with the spices in limen clothes, following the Jews burial custom. At the place where he had been Crucified there was a garden, and in this garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been buried. Since it was the Jewish Day of Preparation and the tomb was near at hand, they laid Jesus there. (Jn. 19: 40-42).<br><br><br><b>Words of Our Lord<br><br><em>I pray not only for these, but for those also who through their words will believe in me. May they be one in us, as you are in me and i am in you, so that the world may believe it was you who sent me</em>.(Jn. 17: 20-21).<br><br><br>Let us pray:</b><br><br>Lord God, the creation of man was a wonderfull work, and his redemption still more wonderfull. May we persevere in right reason against all that entices to sin and to attain to everlasting joy.</b> We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen <br><br><br> V. Have mercy on us, O Lord!<br> R. <b>Have mercy on us</b><br><br><br> <b>Hymn:</b> While my body here decays <br> May my soul they goodness praise, <br> Safe in paradise with thee. Amen<br>
