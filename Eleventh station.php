      <h1>JESUS IS NAILED ON THE CROSS</h1><br> V.  We adore you, and we bless you. <br> R.<b>Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.<br><br><br><center><img src="img/Eleventh.jpg"></center><br>From the Gosple of St. John</b><br><br>There they Crucified him with two others, one on either side with Jesus in the middle. Pilate wrote a notice and had it fixed to the cross; it ran <em>Jesus the Nazarene, King of the Jews</em>(Jn. 19: 18-20).<br><br><br><b>Words of Our Lord<br><br><em>When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that i am He and that i do nothing of myself: what the Father has taught me is what i preach. Now sentence is being passed on this world; now the prince of this world is to be overthrown. And when I am lifted up from the earth, I shall draw all men to myself</em>(Jn. 8: 28; 12: 31-32).<br><br><br>Let us pray<br><br></b>By your will, Lord God, your Son underwent the agony of the cross to break the power of Satan over man. Give your people grace to rise again with Christ.</b> We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen <br><br><br> V. Have mercy on us, O Lord!<br> R. <b>Have mercy on us</b><br><br><br> <b>Hymn:</b> Let me share with thee his pain<br>Who for all my sins was slain<br>Who for me in torments died.<br>
