<h1>JESUS RECIEVES THE CROSS</h1><br> V. We adore you, and we bless you. <br> R.<b>Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.<br><br></b><center><img src="img/Second.jpg"></center><br> From the Gosple of St. John</b> They then took charge of Jesus, and carrying his own cross he went out of the city to the place of the skull or as it was called in Hebrew, Golgotha (Jn. 19: 17).<br><br><br> <b>Words of Our Lord<br><br> <em>If anyone wants to be a follower of mine, let him renounce himself and take up his cross and follow me. For anyone who wants to save his life lose it: but anyone who loses his life will find it. What, then will a man gain if he wins the whole world and ruins his life? Or what has a man to offer in exchange for his life?</em> (Mt. 16: 24-26)<br><br><br>Let us pray:</b><br><br> Almighty and ever-living God, you gave our Saviour the command to become a man and undergo the cross, as an example for all men to follow. We have the lessons of his sufferings: give us also the fellowship of his resurrection. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen <br><br><br> V. Have mercy on us, O Lord!<br> R. <b>Have mercy on us</b><br><br><br> <b>Hymn:</b> Oh, how sad and sore distressed<br> Was that mother highly blest<br> Of the sole-begotten one.<br><br>
