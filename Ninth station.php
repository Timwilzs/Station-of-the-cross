      <h1>JESUS FALLS THE THIRD TIME</h1><br> V.  We adore you, and we bless you. <br> R.<b>Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.<br><br><br><center><img src="img/Ninth.jpg"></center><br> From the Prophet Isaiah</b><br><br> By force and by law he was taken: would anyone plead his cause? Yes, he was torn away for the land of living; for our faults struck down in death. They gave him a grave with the wicked, a tomb with the rich, though he had done no wrong and there had been no perjury in his mouth. Yahweh had been pleased to crush him with suffering. If he offers his like in atonement, he shall see his heirs, he shall have a long life and through him what Yahweh wishes will be done(Is. 53: 8-10).<br><br><br><b>Words of Our Lord<br><br><em>Come to me, all you who labour and are overbudened, and i will give you rest. Shoulder my yoke and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble of heart, and you wil find rest for your souls. Yes, my yoke is easy and my burden light</em>(Mt. 11 28-30).</b><br><br><br> Let us pray:<br><br>Lord, may the suffering and death of Jesus, your only Son, make us pleasing to you. Alone we can do nothing, but may his perfect sacrifice win us your mercy and love. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen <br><br><br> V. Have mercy on us, O Lord!<br> R. <b>Have mercy on us</b><br><br><br> <b>Hymn:</b> Make me feel as thou hast felt:<br> Make my soul to glow and melt<br>With the love of Christ my Lord.<br>
