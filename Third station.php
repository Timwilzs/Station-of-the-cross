      <h1>JESUS FALL THE FIRST TIME UNDER HIS CROSS</h1><br> V.  We adore you, and we bless you. <br> R.<b>Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.<br><br><br><center><img src="img/three.jpg"></center><br> From the prophet Isaiah</b><br><br> The Lord Yahweh has opened my ear. For my part, I made no resistance, neither did i turn away. I offer my back to those who struck me, my cheeck to those who tore at my beard; I did not cover my face against insult and spittle. The Lord Yahweh comes to my help, so that i am untouched by the insults. So, too I set my face like flint; I know i shall not be shamed (Is. 50: 5-7). <br><br><br><b>Words of our Lord<br><br><em>I tell you, most solemnly, unless a wheat grain falls on the ground and dies, it remains only a single grain; but if it dies, it yeilds a rich havest. Anyone who loves his life loses it; anyone who hates his life in this world will keep it for the eternal life. Now my soul is troubed. What shall I say: Father, save me from this hour? But it was for this very reason that i have come to this hour. Father glorify your name!</em> (Jn. 12: 24-25; 27-28)<br><br><br>Let us pray:</b><br><br>Father, through the obidence of Jesus, your servant and your Son, you raised a fallen world. Free us from sin and bring us to the joy that last forever. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen <br> V. Have mercy on us, O Lord!<br> R. <b>Have mercy on us</b><br><br><br> <b>Hymn:</b> Christ above in torment hangs;<br>She beneath beholds the pangs<br> Of her dying glorious Son.<br>
