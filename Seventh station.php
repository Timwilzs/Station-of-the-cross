      <h1>JESUS FALLS THE SECOND TIME</h1><br> V.  We adore you, and we bless you. <br> R.<b>Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.<br><br><br><center><img src="img/seventh.jpg"></center><br> From the Prophet Isaiah</b><br><br>And yet ours were the the sufferings he bore, ours the sorrows he carried. But we, we thought of him as someone punished struck by God, and brought low. Yet he was pierced through for our faults, crushed for our sins. On him lies a punishment that brings us peace, and through his wounds we are healed. We had all gone astray like sheep each taking his own way, and Yahweh burdened him with the sins of all of us.<b><br><br><br>Words of Our Lord<br><br><em>Be like men who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding feast, ready to open the door as soon as he comes and knocks.Happy those servants whom the master finds awake when he comes. You too must stand ready, because the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect</em>(Lk. 12: 36-37; 40).<br><br><br> Let us pray:</b><br><br>Almighty God, grant that we who are constantly betrayed by our own weakness, may draw the breath of new life from the passion and death of your begotten Son. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen <br><br><br> V. Have mercy on us, O Lord!<br> R. <b>Have mercy on us</b><br><br><br> <b>Hymn:</b> For the sins of his own nation,<br>Saw him hang in desolation,<br>Till his spirit forth he sent.<br>
