We adore you, and we bless you. <br> R.<b>Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.<br><br><br><center><img src="img/Thirteenth.jpg"></center><br> From the Gosple of St. John</b><br><br>After this, Joseph of Arimathea. who was a disciple of Jesus -though a secret one because he was afraid of the Jews - asked Pilate to let him remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave permission, so they came and took it away. Nicodemus came as well - the same one who had first come to Jesus at night-time - and he brought a mixture  of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds. (Jn. 19: 38-39).<br><br><br><b>Words of Our Lord<br><br><em>I pray for them; I am not praying for the world but for those who you have given me, because they belong to you: all I have is yours, and all you have is mine, and in them I am glorified. I am not in the world any longer, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, so that they may be one like us</em>.(Jn. 17: 9-11).<br><br><br> Let us pray:</b><br><br>Father, as your Son was raised on the cross, his mother Mary stood by him, sharing his sufferings. May your church be united with Christ in his sufferings and death and so come to share in his rising to new life.</b> We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen <br><br><br> V. Have mercy on us, O Lord!<br> R. <b>Have mercy on us</b><br><br><br> <b>Hymn:</b> By the cross with thee to stay,<br> There with thee to weep and pray,<br>Is all i ask of thee to give.<br>
