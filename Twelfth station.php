      <h1>JESUS DIES ON THE CROSS</h1><br> V.  We adore you, and we bless you. <br> R.<b>Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.<br><br><br><center><img src="img/twelfth.jpg"></center><br>From the Gosple of St. John</b><br><br>Jesus knew that everything had now been completed, and to fulfill the scripture perfectly he said: <em>I am thirsty</em>. A jar full of vinegar stood there, so putting a sponge soaked in vinegar on a hyssop stick they held it upto his mouth. After Jesus had finished taking the vinegar he said, <em>It is accomplished</em>; and bowing his head he gave up  his spirit.(Jn. 17: 1, 4-6)<br><br><br><b>Words of Our Lord<br><br><em>Father, the hour has come: glorify your Son so that your Son may glorify you. I have glorified you on earth and finished the work that you gave me to do. Now, Father, it is time for you to glorify me with that glory I had with you before the world was</em>.(Jn. 17: 1, 4-6).<br><br><br>Let us pray:</b><br><br> Father of mercy, in your great love for us you have given us your only Son. May he take us up into his perfect sacrifice, that we may offer you fitting worship. </b> We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen <br><br><br> V. Have mercy on us, O Lord!<br> R. <b>Have mercy on us</b><br><br><br> <b>Hymn:</b> Let me mingle tears with thee<br>Mourning him who mourned for me<br> All the days that i may live.<br>
