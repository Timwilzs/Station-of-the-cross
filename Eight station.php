      <h1>THE WOMEN OF JERUSELEM MOURN FOR OUR LORD</h1><br> V.  We adore you, and we bless you. <br> R.<b>Because by your holy cross you have redeemed the world.<br><br><br><br><center><img src="img/eight.jpg"></center><br> From the Gosple of St. Luke</b><br><br>Large numbers of people followed him, and of women too, who mourned and lamented for him. But Jesus turned to them and said. <em>Daughters of Jeruselem, do not weep for me: weep rather for yourselves and for your children. For the days will surely come when people will say, <em>Happy are those who are barren, the wombs that have never borne, the breasts that have never suckled!</em>Then they will begin to say to the mountains, <em>Fall on us!</em>: to the hills,<em>Cover us!</em> For if men use the green wood like this, what will happen when it is dry?</em>(Lk. 23: 27-31).<br><br><br><b>Words of Our Lord<br><br><em>Happy those eho mourn: they shall be comforted. Happy those who are persecuted in the cause of right: theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Happy are you when people abuse you and persecute you and speak all kinds of calumny against you on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward will be great in heaven.</em>(Mt. 5 5, 10-46)<br><br><br>Let us pray:</b><br><br> Father, help us to be like Christ your Son, who loved the world and died for our salvation. Inspire us by his love, guide us by his example. We ask this through Christ our Lord. Amen <br><br><br> V. Have mercy on us, O Lord!<br> R. <b>Have mercy on us</b><br><br><br> <b>Hymn:</b> O thou mother!  Fount of love!<br>Touch my spirit from above.<br>Make my heart with thine accord.<br>
